Queue data structure

FIFI: First In First Out
LILO: Last In Last Out

This works just like a movie line.  The first person in line will be the first person to get their ticket. Last person will be the last one to get their ticket. 

```
added first                                     added last
    10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60 -> 70 -> 80 -> 90
```
